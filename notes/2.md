# 2. PARSING

---

## 2.1. Parsers

we may heard of "parser error" or:

- we need to parse this
- after it's parsed
- the parser blows up with this input

the word "parser", as common as, compiler, interpreter, and programming language.

what's parser, according to wikipedia:

- a parser is a software component
- that takes input data (frequently text)
- and builds a data structure (often "parse tree", AST, or other hierarchical structure)
- giving a structural representational of the input
- checking for correct syntax in the process
- often preceded by a separate lexical analyser
  - lexical analyser: creates tokens form the sequence of input characters
  
A parser:

- turns input into a data structure that represents the input
- example in JavaScript

```js
> var input = '{"name": "Mark", "age": 10}';
> var output = JSON.parse(input);
output
{ name: 'Mark', age: 10 }
> output.name
'Mark'
> output.age
10
>
```

- `input` is just some text, a string (in JSON format)
- we pass the `input` to a parser, underlying `JSON.parse` function
- `output` is the data structure that represents the `input`
  - input as a JavaScript object with two fields named `name` and `age`

but we often hear:
 
> "a JSON parser is not the same as a parser for a programming language!, they are differnet!"

actually no, they are NOT different (at least not on a conceptual level)

a JSON parser:

- takes text as input
- builds a data structure that represents the input

this is exactly what parsers of programming languages do. 

The differences?

- for JSON, you can see the data structure when looking at the `input`
- whereas in normal programming language's case:
  - `if ((5 + 2 * 3) == 91) { return computeStuff(input1, input2); }`
  - not immediately can see how it would be represented with a data structure 

additionally:

> "As users of programming languages we seldom get to see or
   interact with the parsed source code, with its internal representation. Lisp programmers are
   the exception to the rule – in Lisp the data structures used to represent the source code are the
   ones used by a Lisp user. The parsed source code is easily accessible as data in the program.
   “Code is data, data is code” is something you hear a lot from Lisp programmers."

- to bring our conceptual understanding of programming language parsers
  - up to the level of our familiarity, intuitiveness with parcers of serialisation languages
  - e.g. `JSON`, `YAML`, `TOML`, `INI`, ...
- we need to understand
  - the data structures parsers produce
  
most interpreters / compilers, the data structure used as the internal representation of the source code:

- syntax tree
- abstract syntax tree a.k.a. AST

```gopher
if (3 * 5 > 10) {
    return "hello";
} else {
    return "goodbye";
}
```

assume:

- we use JavaScript
- have a `MagicLexer`, `MagicParser`
- the AST is built out of JavaScript objects
- the parsing step might produce something like this:

```js
> var input = 'if (3 * 5 > 10) { return "hello"; } else { return "goodbye"; }';
> var tokens = MagicLexer.parse(input);
> MagicParser.parse(tokens);
{
    type: "if-statement",
    condition: {
        type: "operator-expression",
        operator: ">",
        left: {
            type: "operator-expression",
            operator: "*",
            left: { type: "integer-literal", value: 3 },
            right: { type: "integer-literal", value: 5 }
        },
        right: { type: "integer-literal", value: 10 }
    },
    consequence: {
        type: "return-statement",
        returnValue: { type: "string-literal", value: "hello" }
    },
    alternative: {
        type: "return-statement",
        returnValue: { type: "string-literal", value: "goodbye" }
    }
}
```

the AST (the output of the parser), is pretty abstract:

- no parentheses
- no semicolons
- no braces

BUT, it does represent the source code quite accurately.

in short, parsers:

- take source code as input - text or token
- produce a data structure that represents the given source code
- whilst building up the data structure,
  - analyse the input
  - checking that it conforms to the expected structure
  - this process os parsing called "syntactic analysis"

---

## 2.2. Why not a Parser Generator?

- parser generators: `yacc`, `bison`, `ANTLR`
  - they are tools that:
    - when fed with a formal description of a language
    - produce parsers as their output

```note
a formal description of a language -> Parser Generator -> a Parser
```

- Parser Generator
  - input: formal description
  - output: parser
  
the output, parser:

- is set of code that can be compiled/interpreted
- itself fed with source code as input to produce a syntax tree (e.g. AST)

majority of parser generators use "context-free grammar (CFG)" as their input.

- CFG
  - a set of rules
  - that describe how to form correct (valid according to the syntax) sentences in a Language
  
the most common notational formats of CFGs are:

- Backus-Naur Form (BNF)
- Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF)

e.g. a part of [full description](https://tomcopeland.blogs.com/EcmaScript.html) of the EcmaScript syntax in BNF:

```bnf
PrimaryExpression ::= "this"
                    | ObjectLiteral
                    | ( "(" Expression ")" )
                    | Identifier
                    | ArrayLiteral
                    | Literal
Literal ::= ( <DECIMAL_LITERAL>
            | <HEX_INTEGER_LITERAL>
            | <STRING_LITERAL>
            | <BOOLEAN_LITERAL>
            | <NULL_LITERAL>
            | <REGULAR_EXPRESSION_LITERAL> )
Identifier ::= <IDENTIFIER_NAME>
ArrayLiteral ::= "[" ( ( Elision )? "]"
                 | ElementList Elision "]"
                 | ( ElementList )? "]" )
ElementList ::= ( Elision )? AssignmentExpression
                ( Elision AssignmentExpression )*
Elision ::= ( "," )+
ObjectLiteral ::= "{" ( PropertyNameAndValueList )? "}"
PropertyNameAndValueList ::= PropertyNameAndValue ( "," PropertyNameAndValue
                                                  | "," )*
PropertyNameAndValue ::= PropertyName ":" AssignmentExpression
PropertyName ::= Identifier
              | <STRING_LITERAL>

              | <DECIMAL_LITERAL>
```

a parser generator take something similar to BNF/EBNF and turn it into compilable C code.

- most of people say we should use parser generator
- mainly very smart computer scientists already resolved a lot of parsing problems
- this is solved problem
- the results of these smart people's work: CFG, BNF, EBNF, parser generator, advanced parsing techniques
- BUT, learning "how to write parser" is meaningful, helpful, and important
  - you'll see
    - benefit of parser generators and their features
    - drawbacks they have
    - the problems they solved
    
> Most people, that recommend using a parser generator, when others want to get started with interpreters and compilers only do so because they’ve written a parser themselves before. They’ve
  seen the problems and solutions available and decided it’s better to use an existing tool for the
  job. And they’re correct - when you want to get something done and are in a production environment, where correctness and robustness are priorities. Of course you shouldn’t try to write
  your own parser then, especially not if you’ve never written one before.

their goals and our goal is different:

- we want to understand how parser works, whereas they already understood
- also it should be fun!

## 2.3. Writing a Parser for the Gopher Programming Language

- two main strategies when parsing a program:
  - top-down parsing: recursive descent parsing, early parsing, predictive parsing
  - bottom-up parsing
 
> "recursive descent parsing" 

we will do this. in particular, it's a "top down operator precedence" parser.
also a.k.a. "Pratt parser", influenced by Vaughan Pratt.

- differences between: top-down or bottom-up parsing:
  - the former starts with constructing root node of the AST
  - and then descends whilst the latter does it the other way around
  - e.g. recursive descent parser, top-down parser:
    - works from the top down
    - recommended for new comer for parsing
    - since it closely mirrors the way we think about ASTs and their construction
    
limitation of current project:

- won't be fastest of all time
- won't have
  - formal proof of its correctness
  - its error-recovery process
  - detection of erroneous syntax won't be bullet proof

will start with "parsing statements":

- `let` statement
- `return` statement

steps:

- when we can parse statements and the basic structure of our parser stands
- we'll look at expressions
- how to parse these
- we extend the parser to make it capable of parsing a large subset of Gopher programming language
- we build up the necessary structures for our AST

---

## 2.4. Parser's First Steps: Parsing `let` Statements

- in Gopher, variable bindings are statements of the following form:

```gopher
let x = 5;
let y = 10;
let foobar = add(5, 5);
let barfoo = 5 * 5 / 10 + 18 - add(5, 5) + multiply(124);
let anotherName = barfoo;
```

- they are `let` statements
- bind a value to the given name
- e.g. `let x = 5;`
  - binds the value `5` to the name `x`

> "To parse `let` statement correctly?"

- the parser produces an AST
- AST accurately represents the information contained in the original `let` statement

example code:

```gopher
let x = 10;
let y = 15;

let add = fn(a, b) {
    return a + b;
};
```

- a program is a series of statements
- so programs in Gopher are also a series of statements
- example above, we can see three `let` statements
- the statement follows this form:

```ebnf
let <identifier> = <expression>;
```

- a `let` statement consists of two chaning part:
  - identifier: e.g. `x`, `y`, `add`
  - expression: e.g. `10`, `15`, the function literal (`fn(a,b){return a+b;}`)

- statements vs expressions
  - statements: do not produce values, e.g. `let x = 5`
  - expressions: produce values, e.g. `5`
  - why? `let x = 5` does not produce a value, it's statement, whereas `5` does (the value it produces is `5`)

it can depend on languages, though:

- some languages, function literals like `fn(x, y){ return x + y; }` are expression
  - can be used in any place where any other expressions is allowed
- some other programming languages
  - function literals can only be part of a function declaration statement
    - e.g. in the top level of the program
- some languages also have "if expressions"
  - where conditionals are expressions and produce a value
  
entirely choice of language designers. in Gopher, we consider function literals as expressions.

let's implement our [ast/ast.go](../gopher/ast/ast.go)

```note
let x = 5;

could be represented by an AST:

          --------------
         | *ast.Program |
         |--------------|
         |  Statements  |
          --------------
                |
                |
                v
          -------------------
         | *ast.LetStatement |
         |-------------------|
      ---|      Name         |
     |   |-------------------|
     |   |      Value        |---
     |    -------------------    |
     |                           |
     v                           v
   -----------------     -----------------
  | *ast.Identifier |   | *ast.Expression |
   -----------------     -----------------
```

let's implement our [parser/parser.go](../gopher/parser/parser.go)

- basic idea and structure behind a Recursive Descent Parser
- major parts of such a parser in pseudocode:

```pseudocode
function parseProgram() {
    program = newProgramASTNode()
    
    advanceTokens()

    for (currentToken() != EOF_TOKEN) {
        statement = null

        if (currentToken() == LET_TOKEN) {
            statement = parseLetStatement()
        } else if (currentToken() == RETURN_TOKEN) {
            statement = parseReturnStatement()
        } else if (currentToken() == IF_TOKEN) {
            statement = parseIfStatement()
        }
        
        if (statement != null) {
            program.Statements.push(statement)
        }
        
        advanceTokens()
    }

    return program
}

function parseLetStatement() {
    advanceTokens()

    identifier = parseIdentifier()

    advanceTokens()

    if currentToken() != EQUAL_TOKEN {
        parseError("no equal sign!")

        return null
    }

    advanceTokens()

    value = parseExpression()

    variableStatement = newVariableStatementASTNode()
    variableStatement.identifier = identifier
    variableStatement.value = value

    return variableStatement
}

function parseIdentifier() {
    identifier = newIdentifierASTNode()
    identifier.token = currentToken()

    return identifier
}

function praseExpression() {
    if (currentToken() == INTEGER_TOKEN) {
        if (nextToken() == PLUS_TOKEN) {
            return parseOperatorExpression()
        } else if (nextToken() == SEMICOLON_TOKEN) {
            return parseIntegerLiteral()
        } else if (currentToken() == LEFT_PAREN) {
            return parseGroupedExpression()
        }
    // [...]
    }
}

function parseOperatorExpression() {
    operatorExpression = newOperatorExpression()

    operatorExpression.left = parseIntegerLiteral()
    operatorExpression.operator = currentToken()
    operatorExpression.right = parseExpression()

    return operatorExpression()     
}
// [...]
```

- many omissions, but the main idea of "recursive-descent parsing" is in the pseudo code
- entry point: `parseProgram`
  - this constructs the root node of the AST: `newProgramASTNode()`
- builds the child nodes, the statements, by calling other functions
  - which AST node to construct based on the current token
  - these functions call each other again, recursively
  - most recursive part: `parseExpression`
  - example: `5 + 5`
    - i. need to first parse `5 +`
    - ii. and then call `parseExpression()` again to parse the rest
      - since after `+`, we can also get another "operator expression", e.g. `5 + 5 * 10`
      - main beautiful part of the parser, making heavy use of "Pratt parsing"
      
anyways, the pseudocode shows that it repeatedly advances the tokens from lexer,
and checks the current token to decide what to do next:

- call another parsing function

or

- throw an error

About error handling, after we get wrong input like this
  
```gopher
let x 5;
let y = 10;
let  838383;
```

rather than:

```gopher
let x = 5;
let y = 10;
let foobar = 838383;
```

we should be able to detect easily what we expected and what we got like this:

```terminal
$ go test ./parser/
--- FAIL: TestLetStatements (0.00s)
    parser_test.go:89: parser has 2 errors
    parser_test.go:92: parser error: "expected next token to be =, got INT instead"
    parser_test.go:92: parser error: "expected next token to be IDENT, got INT instead"

```

this is done at `parser/parser.go` by:

- `expectPeek`
- `peekError`

even if the current error message is missing:

- line number
- column number

it helps a lot to find out what kind of problem we faced during parsing.

---

## 2.5. Parsing `return` Statements

TODO:

- flesh out sparse looking `ParseProgram` method
- parse `return` statements
  - define the structures in the `ast` package that can represent the `return` statement it the AST
  
examples of `return` statements:

```gopher
return 5;
return 10;
return add(15);
```

structure:

```ebnf
return <expression>;
```

this consist of a keyword, `return` with an following expression.
`ast.ReturnStatement` can be simple. 

adding test can be also similar to what we have done for `let` statement. we can write:

- `parser/parser.go`

---

## 2.6. Parsing Expressions

- parsing expressions
- parsing statements: relatively straightforward
  - process tokens from "left to right"
  - expect or reject the next tokens
  - if everything ok, return an AST node
  
parsing expressions:

- few more challenges

when we want to parse the following arithmetic expression:

```gopher
5 * 5 + 10
``` 

in the AST, we want to represents the expression like:

```gopher
((5 * 5) + 10)
``` 

- `5 * 5` needs to be "deeper" in the AST
  - "deeper" in the AST?, evaluated earlier than the addition
  - to produce an AST that looks like this, parser has to know about operator precedences
    - operator precedences: the precedence of `*` is higher than `+`
    
another example:

```gopher
5 * (5 + 10)
```

- the parenthesis group together the `5 + 10`
- give them a "precedence bump":
  - the addition, `+`, has to be evaluated before the multiplication, `*`
  - reason:
    - parentheses have a higher precedence than the `*` operator
  - cf. there are few more cases where precedence is playing a crucial role
  
the other big challenge:

- in expressions tokens of the same type can appear in multiple positions
  - whereas, `let` token can only appear once at the beginning of a `let` statement
  - this makes easy to determine what the rest of the statement is supposed to be

example with `-` operator appears at the beginning of the expression:

```gopher
-5 - 10
```

- as a prefix operator (`-` at `-5`), 
- then, as an infix operator (`-` between `5 - 10`)
- a variation of the same challenge:

```gopher
5 * (add(2, 3) + 10)
```

- the outer pair of parentheses denotes a grouped expression
- the inner pair denotes a "call expression"

**The validity of a token's position, depends on the context."**

### Expression in Gopher

- in Gopher Programming Language (hereafter Gopher PL)
- everything besides `let` and `return` statement is an expression
- expressions come in different varieties:

expressions involving prefix operators:

```gopher
-5
!true
!false
```

infix operators (or "binary operators"):

```gopher
5 + 5
5 - 5
5 / 5
5 * 5
```

comparison operators:

```gopher
foo == bar
foo != bar
foo < bar
foo > bar
```

can use parentheses to group expressions and influence the order of evaluation:

```gopher
5 * (5 + 5)
((5 + 5) * 5) * 5
```

call expressions:

```gopher
add(1, 2)
add(add(1, 2), add(3, 4))
max(5, add(5, (5 * 5)))
```

identifiers as expressions:

```gopher
foo * bar / foobar
add(foo, bar)
```

- functions in Gopher, "first-class citizens"
- function literals are expressions
  - can use `let` statement to "bind" a function to a name.
  
function literal is just the expression in the statement:

```gopher
let add = fn(x, y) { return x + y };
```

a function literal in stead/place of an identifier:

```gopher
fn (x, y) { return x + y }(5, 5)
(fn (x) { return x }(5) + 10 ) * 10
```

in addition, `if` statement in Gopher PL:

```gopher
let result = if (10 > 5) { true } else { false };
result // true
```

all different forms of expressions above:
- need a good approach to parse them correctly
  - understandable way
  - extendable way (as there is a huge possibility to extend PL in the near future) 
- next things to consider: `Vaughan Pratt`

### Top Down Operator Precedence (Or: Pratt Parsing)

- a paper: "Top Down Operator Precedence" bly Vaughan Pratt, 1973.

> [...] is very simple to understand, trivial to implement, easy to use, 
> extremely efficient in practice if not in theory, yet flexible enough
> to meet most reasonable syntatic needs of users [...]

- did not get huge following,
- but, recently got: JavaScript
  - Douglas Crockford
    - "JavaScript: The Good Parts" fame
    - [Top Down Operator Precedence](http://crockford.com/javascript/)
    - used JSLint
  - Bob Nystrom, author of "Game Programming Patterns"
    - [Pratt Parsers: Expression Parsing Made Easy](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2011/03/19/pratt-parsers-expression-parsing-made-easy/)
    
Top Down Operator Precedence Parsing, or Pratt Parsing:

- invented as an alternative to parsers based on context-free grammar & BNF (Backus-Naur-Form)
- main differences:
  - instead of associating parsing function (e.g. `parseLetStatement` method) with grammar rules (in BNF/EBNF)
  - Pratt associates functions (a.k.a. "semantic code") with single token types
- important:
  - each token type can have two parsing functions associated with
  - depending on token's position: "infix" or "prefix"
  
> How to associate parsing functions with grammar rules?

let's think about terminology first.
