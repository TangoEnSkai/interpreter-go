# Introduction

---

> "Interpreters are magical."

- surface level: deceptively simple: text in, something out
- something in, then it becomes **meaningful**.
- machine: 0 or 1
- an interpreter translates languages (between machine and human)

> "How does it work?"

- with understanding on lexers and parsers
- maybe with `C` like language with `{`, `}`, and `;`
- our own interpreter for our own programming language (from scratch)
- no 3rd party tools and libraries

> "some interpreters are small, others are much more elaborated."

- small and tiny interpreter: don't bother with parsing steps, interpret inputs right away
- complex interpreter: highly optimised, advanced parsing and evaluation techniques
  - do not just evaluate their input, but compile it into an internal representation called `bytecode`
  - `JIT` interpreters: compile the input just-in-time into native machne code that gets then executed
  
> "in between of these..."

- interpreters that parse the source code, build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) out of it and evaluate the tree
  - "tree-walking" interpreter
  - it "walks" the AST and interprets it
  - our own lexer 
  - our own parser 
  - our own tree representation
  - our own evaluator
  - "tokens"
  - "AST"
  - language extension with new data structures and built-in functions

## THE MONKEY PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE & INTERPRETER

- every interpreter: built to interpret a specific programming language
  - this is "how" you implement a programming language
  - w/o compiler/interpreter programming language is nothing more than an idea or specification
  
- our own "Monkey Programming Language"
  - we will parse and evaluate it

- Features
  - C-like syntax
  - variable bindings
  - integers and booleans
  - arithmetic expressions
  - built-in functions
  - first-class and higher-order functions
  - closures
  - a string data structure
  - an array data structure
  - a hash data structure
  
for example, how we bind a value to names in Monkey:

```monkey
let age = 1;
let name = "Monkey";
let result = 10 * (20 / 2);
```

integers, booleans, strings, arrays, hashes.

```moneky
let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

hash, values are associated with keys:

```monkey
let mark = {"name": "Mark", "age": 10}
```

accessing the elements in arrays and hashes with **index expression**:

```monkey
myArray[0] // 1
mark["name"] // "Mark"
```

the `let` statements can be used to bind a functions to names:

```monkey
let add = fn(a, b) { return a + b; }
```

also supports, "implicit return values"

```monkey
let add = fn(a, b) { a + b; }
```

how to call:

```monkey
add (1, 2);
```

an example of more complex function, `fibonacci` with recursive calls:

```monkey
let fibonacci = fn(x) {
    if (x == 0) {
        0
    } else {
        if (x == 1) {
            1
        } else {
            fibonacci(x - 1) + fibonacci(x - 2);
        }
    }
};
```

a special type of function, "high order functions" which are functions that take other functions as arguments:

```monkey
let twice = fn (f, x) {
    return f(f(x));
}

let addTwo = fn(x) {
    return x + 2;
}

twice(addTwo, 2);   // takes 2 arguments: func called `addTwo`, and the interger `2` 
                    // this calls `addTwo` two times, with the first `2` as argument
                    // thus, we will get 6
```

- function in this language is just "values", same as integers or strings.
- this feature is called: "first class function"
  - first class function: a function that was built with the intention of being passed around to other functions
  - high order function: a function which accepts one of these first class functions as an argument

Main goals:

- interpreter, we will tokenize and parse
- the source code in a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-eval-print_loop)
- building up an internal representation of the code, as AST
- evaluate this tree

in detail, major parts:

- the lexer
- the parser
- the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
- the internal object system
- the evaluator

## Why Go?

- easy to read and subsequently understand
- the great toolings: `gofmt`, testing framework
- can concentrate only on 'interpreter', w/o worrying about 3rd party libs.
- close to C/C++, Rust
- focus on simplicity

## Resources, etc.

- https://interpreterbook.com/waiig_code_1.7.zip
- Go 1.0 or above
- the example codes were used [Go 1.7](https://blog.golang.org/go1.7) to [Go 1.14](https://blog.golang.org/go1.14)
- `direnv` can be used to change the environment of your shell 
  - according to an `.envrc` file that sets the `GOPATH` correctly
