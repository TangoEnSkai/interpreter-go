# Gopher

---

Gopher is subset of Monkey Language. This is a personal playground to learn techniques of writing an interpreter (Monkey language),
but that is not the end goal, we are going to evolve Monkey as the better animal, Gopher!

Language spec and design is TBD but that would be pretty closer to Monkey, or could be:

- more functional
- more Go-like

Nothing fixed yet, though.

## Status

- Evolve Monkey to Gopher interpreter implementation (TBD) 
- Propose Gopher Language Design of Gopher with Language Spec (TBD)
- Mimicking Monkey Language (WIP)
